/* Key Logic: - Each palindromic substring has a "center" â€” either a single character or a pair
                of characters.
              - There are 2n - 1 possible centers in a string of length n:
                  - n centers at each character (odd-length palindromes)
                  - n - 1 centers between characters (even-length palindromes)
              - For each center, expand outward while the characters on both sides are equal.
              - Each time a valid palindrome is found during expansion, increment the count.
              - This method avoids recomputation and gives an efficient O(n^2) time complexity. */
